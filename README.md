Who can host on Airbnb? Behind every stay is a host, a real person who can give you the details you need to check in and feel at home. They can interact with guests in different ways, depending on the type of place or experience they booked lmost anyone can be a host. It's free to sign up and list both stays and experiences. Whether theyâ€™re hosting a place to stay or a local activity, all hosts are expected to meet our quality standards every time (link)
