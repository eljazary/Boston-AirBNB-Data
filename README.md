 participating in Airbnb is a way to earn some income from their property, but with the risk that the guest might do damage to it.
 we will try to figure out the price prediction by two different model by applying CRISP-DM Methodology
  1. Business understanding
  2. Data understanding
  3. Data preparation
  4. Modeling
  5. Evaluation
  6. Deployment
